RESULST:

This code is a Python GUI application that uses the Tkinter library to create a user interface for a personal
assistant. The program allows users to open an evaluation file, process data from it, and view the results in a
text box. It also includes features such as check boxes for case conversion and a button to clean the log data.

The code imports several modules from the Tkinter library: `tk`, `filedialog`, `messagebox`, `ScrolledText`, and
`functions`. The module `functions` is imported to access the functions `open_file()`, `process_data()`,
`clean_log_data()`, and `copy_result()`.

The program defines several variables at the top of the file:

* `eval_data`: This variable stores the data from the evaluation file. It is set to `None` initially.
* `workfolder`: This variable stores the path to the folder containing the evaluation file. It is also set to
`None` initially.
* `search_value`: This variable stores the value entered in the search box.
* `file_path`: This variable stores the path to the evaluation file.
* `result`: This variable stores the result of processing the data from the evaluation file.

The program also defines several functions:

* `get_eval_data()`: This function is called when the "Open File" button is pressed. It opens a file dialog box
and allows the user to select an evaluation file. The selected file path is stored in the `file_path` variable,
and the contents of the file are read into the `eval_data` variable.
* `get_process()`: This function is called when the "Process Data" button is pressed. It processes the data from
the evaluation file based on the values entered in the check boxes (uppercase, lowercase, title case) and displays
the results in the text box. The `search_value` variable is used to search for specific data in the evaluation
file.
* `clean_log_data()`: This function is called when the "Clean Data" button is pressed. It cleans the log data by
removing any duplicate lines.
* `copy_result()`: This function is called when the "Copy Result" button is pressed. It copies the result to the
clipboard.
* `close_app()`: This function is called when the "Close App" button is pressed. It closes the program.

The program also defines a Tkinter root window and adds several widgets to it, including text boxes for displaying
the results, buttons for opening and processing data, check boxes for case conversion, and a close button. The
program uses `grid()` method to position the widgets on the window.

RESULST:

This code is a Python script that uses the Tkinter library to create a simple GUI for searching and processing
data. It allows the user to select a file from their local machine using the `filedialog` module, read the
contents of the selected file, and then search for a specific value within the text. The results are then written
to a log file and displayed in the GUI's text box.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. The first block of code imports the necessary modules from the standard library and other libraries. It
includes `tkinter`, `filedialog`, `messagebox`, `pyperclip`, and `ollama` for reading and writing files,
displaying dialog boxes, copying data to the clipboard, and processing text using a machine learning model.
2. The next block of code defines a function called `open_file()` that allows the user to select a file from their
local machine using the `filedialog` module. It returns the path to the selected file and the name of the folder
containing it.
3. The third block of code defines a function called `process_data()` that takes in four arguments: the path to
the selected file, the contents of the file as a string, the name of the folder containing the file, and the value
to search for within the text. It uses the `ollama` library to generate a response based on the input prompt and
returns the generated response, the actual response, and the data log value.
4. The fourth block of code defines a function called `data_log()` that takes in four arguments: the path to the
selected file, the name of the folder containing the file, the actual response, and the value to search for within
the text. It formats the data into a string and appends it to a log file located in the same folder as the
selected file.
5. The fifth block of code defines a function called `clean_log_data()` that cleans up the log data by removing
any unnecessary characters or whitespace.
6. The final block of code defines a function called `copy_result()` that copies the contents of the text box to
the clipboard using the `pyperclip` library and displays a message box with the result. It also sets up the GUI
for the user to enter the value to search for and click the "Search" button.
7. The code then creates an instance of the `Tkinter.Tk()` class, which represents the root window of the GUI, and
calls the `mainloop()` method on it. This starts the event loop that allows the user to interact with the GUI.

RESULST:
This code is a Python script that uses the `ollama` library to generate responses based on prompts. The script has
several functions:

* `open_file()`: Opens a file dialog box and allows the user to select a file to read from. It returns the path of
the selected file, as well as the current working directory and the contents of the selected file.
* `timestamp_format()`: Returns the current timestamp in the format of "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S".
* `process_data()`: Processes the data read from a file using the `ollama` library to generate responses based on
prompts. It takes the path of the selected file, the contents of the file, the current working directory, and a
search value as input, and returns the generated response, as well as writes the response to a log file.
* `data_log()`: Writes the data to a log file in the format of "timestamp\n P: Busca todo lo relacionado con:
{search_value}.\n Dentro del siguiente arcvhivo: {file_path}\n R: {actual_responce}".
* `clean_log_data()`: Cleans the log data by deleting all the text in a text box.
* `copy_result()`: Copies the result data to the clipboard using the `pyperclip` library.

The script also uses several other libraries, including `tkinter`, `filedialog`, `messagebox`, `scrolledtext`, and
`os`.
