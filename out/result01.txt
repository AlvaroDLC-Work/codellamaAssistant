RESULST:

This code is a Python GUI application that uses the Tkinter library to create a user interface for a personal
assistant. The program allows users to open an evaluation file, process data from it, and view the results in a
text box. It also includes features such as check boxes for case conversion and a button to clean the log data.

The code imports several modules from the Tkinter library: `tk`, `filedialog`, `messagebox`, `ScrolledText`, and
`functions`. The module `functions` is imported to access the functions `open_file()`, `process_data()`,
`clean_log_data()`, and `copy_result()`.

The program defines several variables at the top of the file:

* `eval_data`: This variable stores the data from the evaluation file. It is set to `None` initially.
* `workfolder`: This variable stores the path to the folder containing the evaluation file. It is also set to
`None` initially.
* `search_value`: This variable stores the value entered in the search box.
* `file_path`: This variable stores the path to the evaluation file.
* `result`: This variable stores the result of processing the data from the evaluation file.

The program also defines several functions:

* `get_eval_data()`: This function is called when the "Open File" button is pressed. It opens a file dialog box
and allows the user to select an evaluation file. The selected file path is stored in the `file_path` variable,
and the contents of the file are read into the `eval_data` variable.
* `get_process()`: This function is called when the "Process Data" button is pressed. It processes the data from
the evaluation file based on the values entered in the check boxes (uppercase, lowercase, title case) and displays
the results in the text box. The `search_value` variable is used to search for specific data in the evaluation
file.
* `clean_log_data()`: This function is called when the "Clean Data" button is pressed. It cleans the log data by
removing any duplicate lines.
* `copy_result()`: This function is called when the "Copy Result" button is pressed. It copies the result to the
clipboard.
* `close_app()`: This function is called when the "Close App" button is pressed. It closes the program.

The program also defines a Tkinter root window and adds several widgets to it, including text boxes for displaying
the results, buttons for opening and processing data, check boxes for case conversion, and a close button. The
program uses `grid()` method to position the widgets on the window.
